### Preprocessing is the first stage of C Build process in which all the preprocessor directives are evaluated.
 * The input file for this stage is *.c file.
 * The output file is *.i or preprocessed file.
 * The preprocessor strips out comments from the input c file. Evaluate preprocessor directive by making substitution for lines started with #, and then produces a   pure C code without any preprocessor directives.
 * Syntax: gcc -E main.c - o main.i
### Compiler
 * The input file for this stage is *.i file.
 * The output file is *.s file.
 * Syntax gcc main.i -S -o main.s
### Assembler: 
In this stage the assembly code that is generated by the compiler gets converted into object code by the assembler.
 * The input file for this stage is *.asm file.
 * The output file is *.o or *.obj file + library.
 * Note that compilers nowadays can generate an object code without the need of an independent assembler.
 * Syntax: gcc - c main.s -o main.o
### Linker:

 * The input file for this stage is *.o file, and c standard libraries .
 * The output file is relocatable file.
