## Lession 4: Build process in C
![Build process](https://fastbitlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Figure-2-1-800x409.png)

### Preprocessing is the first stage of C Build process in which all the preprocessor directives are evaluated.
 * The input file for this stage is *.c file.
 * The output file is *.i or preprocessed file.
 * The preprocessor strips out comments from the input c file. Evaluate preprocessor directive by making substitution for lines started with #, and then produces a   pure C code without any preprocessor directives.
 * Syntax: gcc -E main.c - o main.i
### Compiler
 * The input file for this stage is *.i file.
 * The output file is *.s file.
 * Syntax gcc main.i -S -o main.s
### Assembler: 
In this stage the assembly code that is generated by the compiler gets converted into object code by the assembler.
 * The input file for this stage is *.asm file.
 * The output file is *.o or *.obj file + library.
 * Note that compilers nowadays can generate an object code without the need of an independent assembler.
 * Syntax: gcc - c main.s -o main.o
### Linker:

 * The input file for this stage is *.o file, and c standard libraries .
 * The output file is relocatable file.
## Lession 5: Pointer
### Integer pointer:
 * Pointer point to integer variable int * <name>.
### Void pointer:
 * Pointer point to any type of variable but need to cast(ép kiểu)
### NULL pointer:
 * Pointer point to notthing int * ptr = NULL/0.
### FUNC pointer:
 * Pointer point to func:
     void(*ptr)(int, int);
### Pointer to pointer:
 * Pointer to keep the address of another pointer.
## Lession 6: Memory Layout
![Memory layout](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/memoryLayoutC.jpg)
### Text
 * Read-only, contains executable instructions, contain const
### Initialized Data Segment (data)
 * Read and write
 * ontains the global variables and static variables that are initialized by the programmer.
 * Free when program is end.
### Uninitialized Data Segment (bss)
 * Read and write
 * Contains all global variables and static variables that are initialized to zero or do not have explicit initialization in source code.
 * Free when program is end.
### Stack
 * The stack area contains the program stack, a LIFO structure, typically located in the higher parts of memmory.
 * Stack, where automatic variables are stored, along with information that is saved each time a function is called.
 * Read-write
 * Free when out of function
### Heap
 * Heap is the segment where dynamic memmory allocation usually takes place: malloc, calloc, realloc.
 * Read and write
 * Free when use free func.
### Difference between Heap and Stack
 * Stack is fixed memmory capacity 1MB with window and 8MB Linux and faster to access than Heap. Auto free when out func. 
 * Heap is dynamic allocated memmory with dynamic memmory capacity and free by programmer.
### Error
 * Stack overflow (xử dụng quá nhiều vùng nhớ)
 * Heap overflow (không giải phóng vùng nhớ)
 * Memmory leak.
 * Dangling pointer.
## Lession 7: Variable type
### Static
 *  A static variable preserves its previous value in its previous scope and is not initialized again in the new scope.
 *  Static variables are allocated memory in the data segment, not the stack segment.
 *  Static variables (like global variables) are initialized as 0 if not initialized explicitly.
 *  Static global variables and functions are also possible in C/C++. The purpose of these is to limit the scope of a variable or function to a file. Access to static functions is restricted to the file where they are declared
### Extern
 * Extern keyword in C applies to C variables (data objects) and C functions. Basically, the extern keyword extends the visibility of the C variables and C functions.
### Volatile
 * Variable that changing while program is running and it used to tell compiler not to optimaze this line code.
